SpeedyShare is a peer-to-peer file transfer application. It doesn't require any registration or anything fancy to use. All you need to transfer a file is an IP-address, and a file of course! Have in mind that since SpeedyShare is using P2P, you might need to use port-forwarding to send a file across the internet.

Downloading SpeedyShare automatically includes Qt4.8. If you already have Qt4.8 installed, you can select to download the standalone .exe. If you have no idea what was just written, go for the first one. <br><br>
